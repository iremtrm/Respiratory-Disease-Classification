# AsthmaCOPD-ML

Project Description
This project aims to classify **Asthma** and **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)** using anonymized patient data. The dataset includes various features such as demographic, clinical, lifestyle, and genetic information. The main purpose is to identify important variables and develop a reliable classification model for early diagnosis.

The analysis was done in **Python**, and several machine learning techniques were applied to improve the prediction accuracy.

- Analyze the structure of patient data  
- Identify the most important features for classification  
- Build models to distinguish between Asthma and COPD  
- Interpret the results and model performance

##  Tools and Libraries

- Python 3.x  
- pandas, numpy  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib, seaborn  


- Patient records with anonymized information  
- Features: Demographics, clinical history, lifestyle, genetics  
- Target: Diagnosis (Asthma or COPD)
